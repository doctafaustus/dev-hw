Right now, he uses his eyes as his primary way of gathering information. He is building up the connections between his brain and his eyes and is sensitive to light and sound. Includes a Mobile, Card Sets and Holders, Wooden Book, Rattle, Lullaby Lyrics, Mittens, and a little something for you!',

We named this kit "The Senser" because your baby is tasting, mouthing, and feeling everything she can get her hands on right now â€” and working on getting herself closer to what looks and sounds exciting to her. We designed everything in this kit to help you both make the most of this stage.'

The Clear Tube with its Stacking Rings teaches foundational lessons about gravity, volume, rolling and sliding, and more. You may have noticed your little one enjoys removing items from containers (sometimes by dumping!), and our Little Grip Canister Set is just right for that kind of learning, designed specifically for a baby\'s hands.'
